I’m setting up the website for STC – IISER Thiruvananthapuram.
This repository is not for trial runs since the link has already been shared with the concerned authority. Please first test your changes in the trial repo, and only if everything works, push the final code here. Make sure the structure remains clean and properly organized. Once you push, update the details in the WhatsApp group.
