/*
Welcome to the content hub for your website!

To update the content on your website, you only need to edit this file.
This approach keeps all your data in one place, making it easy to manage without having to edit any HTML files directly.

Instructions:
- To change text, simply replace the text inside the quotes (e.g., "Your Name").
- To change an image, replace the image URL (e.g., "https://picsum.photos/seed/your-seed/200/200").
- To add a new item (like a team member or an event), copy one of the existing blocks (everything from the opening `{` to the closing `}`), paste it at the end of the list, and update the content. Make sure to add a comma after the closing `}` of the item before it.
