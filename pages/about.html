                <p>The Science and Technology Council (STC) of IISER Thiruvananthapuram is a student-run organization committed to fostering a vibrant culture of science and technology on campus. Our primary mission is to provide a platform for students to explore their scientific interests beyond the curriculum, to encourage innovation, and to promote a spirit of collaboration and inquiry among the student body.</p>

                <h2 class="section-title-sub">Our History</h2>
                <p>Founded in 2016, the STC has grown from a small group of passionate students into a large and active council that oversees a wide range of clubs and activities. Over the years, we have organized numerous events, workshops, and competitions, including our flagship science fest, Anvesha, which attracts participants from all over India. We are proud of our legacy of promoting scientific curiosity and excellence.</p>

                <p>The STC is governed by a student council, which includes General Secretaries, Joint Secretaries, a Treasurer, and heads for various operational domains. The council works under the guidance of a Faculty-in-Charge (FIC) and in coordination with the Dean of Student Affairs (DOSA). Under the STC, there are several affiliated clubs, each focusing on a specific domain of science or technology, from computing and robotics to astronomy and biology.</p>
