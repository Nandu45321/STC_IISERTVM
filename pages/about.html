                <p>
The Science and Technology Council (STC) at IISER Thiruvananthapuram is committed to promoting scientific inquiry, technological advancement, and interdisciplinary research within the institute. Its mission is to cultivate an intellectually stimulating environment where students and researchers are encouraged to explore innovative solutions to complex problems. By organizing academic seminars, workshops, outreach programs, and collaborative projects, the STC seeks to enhance scientific thinking, foster creativity, and build leadership skills among its members. The council also emphasizes the importance of responsible and ethical research, aiming to bridge the gap between scientific knowledge and a student's understanding of research.</p>

The STC was established to serve as a central platform that connects the diverse academic interests of students and faculty at IISER TVM. Founded by a group of enthusiastic students, in response to a growing interest in scientific clubs and platforms for discussion, the council began as a forum to exchange ideas and support research initiatives across various scientific disciplines. Over the years, it has expanded its activities to include seminars, talks, exhibitions, school outreaches, and public engagement efforts. Through its continued dedication to excellence in science and technology, the STC plays a vital role in shaping the research culture of IISER TVM, inspiring innovation, and nurturing the next generation of researchers.</p>
