- **Lazy Loading**: Images load only when needed
- **Responsive Images**: Different sizes served based on device

### 3. **Enhanced User Experience**
- **Smooth Animations**: CSS transitions and transforms
- **Loading States**: Visual feedback while images load
- **Intersection Observer**: Efficient lazy loading implementation
- **Service Worker**: Caching for offline access and faster subsequent loads

### 4. **Hero Section Optimization**
